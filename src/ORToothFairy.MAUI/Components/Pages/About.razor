    <h1>About ORToothFairy</h1>

    <p>
        ORToothFairy connects Oregonians with dental hygienists who provide care
        in non-traditional settings - from your home to care facilities to
        community health centers.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
    <p>
        In Oregon, dental hygienists can practice independently under an
        Extended Practice Permit, bringing preventive dental care directly
        to people who need it most. But finding these providers isn't easy -
        until now.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
    <p>
        Whether you're a family looking for convenient care, a care facility
        seeking on-site services, or a dental practice needing coverage,
        we help you find the right match.
    </p>
