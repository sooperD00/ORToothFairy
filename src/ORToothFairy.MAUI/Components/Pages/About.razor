    <h1>About ORToothFairy</h1>

    <p>
        ORToothFairy connects Oregonians with dental hygienists — whether you need 
        care at home, at a facility, or just want to find someone great nearby.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
    <p>
        Oregon dental hygienists can practice independently under an Extended Practice 
        Permit, bringing preventive care to homes, schools, care facilities, and 
        community centers. But there's never been an easy way to find them — until now.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
    <p>
        Families looking for convenient care. Care facilities needing on-site services. 
        Dental practices seeking coverage. We help you find the right match.
    </p>
