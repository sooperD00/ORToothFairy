## When You Get Stuck

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"MAUI build errors"**
- Clean solution: `dotnet clean && dotnet build`
- Check SDK version: `dotnet --version` (need 8.0+)
- Update workloads: `dotnet workload update`

**"Can't connect to database"**
- Check connection string in `appsettings.json`
- Verify PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready`
- Check firewall/network (Azure ‚Üí Railway connection)

**"Geolocation not working"**
- HTTPS required for browser geolocation
- Check app permissions (iOS/Android)
- Verify lat/lon are valid numbers

**"Distance calculations seem wrong"**
- Check Haversine formula units (radians vs degrees)
- Verify lat/lon order (lat is Y, lon is X)
- Use PostGIS `ST_Distance` if doing complex queries

### Where to Ask for Help
1. **Claude** (that's me! I can debug code, explain concepts)
2. **Stack Overflow** (search first, 90% of questions answered)
3. **.NET Discord/Reddit** (r/dotnet, r/csharp)
4. **MAUI GitHub Issues** (if you hit a framework bug)

- ‚úÖ App deployed and accessible
- ‚úÖ GitHub repo with clean structure
- ‚úÖ Resume line: "Built cross-platform healthcare app with .NET MAUI"

### Business Success (Revenue)
- ‚úÖ 10+ paying practitioners ($150/mo)
- ‚úÖ Covers costs + modest side income

---

## Emergency Pivots (If Things Go Wrong)

### If MAUI is too hard
‚Üí Fall back to Blazor Server (web-only, simpler)
‚Üí Still modern .NET, still portfolio-worthy

### If neighbor drops out
‚Üí Finish as portfolio piece anyway
‚Üí Pivot to different niche (e.g., other trade workers)

### If timeline stretches too long
‚Üí Deploy v1 with just search (no maps, no polish)
‚Üí "Shipped is better than perfect"

### If revenue doesn't materialize
‚Üí Open-source the code (MIT license)
‚Üí Use as case study for consulting work

## Your Next Action (Right Now)

**Step 1:** Talk to lawyer husband (1 hour this week)  
**Step 2:** Talk to neighbor about ownership split (30 min)  
**Step 3:** Decide on LLC or not (by end of week)  
**Step 4:** Set up GitHub repo (30 min)  
**Step 5:** Start Milestone 1 (project setup)

---

**Remember:** Deploy early, deploy often. Get something in her hands ASAP, even if imperfect. You can always iterate!

üöÄ **You got this!**
