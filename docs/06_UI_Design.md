# OR Tooth Fairy - Monetization Paths

>Last Updated: 11/21/2025


## B2B subscription

- Dental hygienists pay a monthly subscription (~$20-50/month) to be listed and receive patient referrals

This is the cleanest model - hygienists understand business expenses, they're already paying for liability insurance and licensing, and the value proposition is clear (you send them patients who need emergency care and are willing to pay out-of-pocket rates)

## Clients (Patients/Other Businesses)
- Patients use the app free. They're already stressed and price-sensitive, so you remove friction by making their side zero-cost

- Other businesses (e.g. dentists, care facilities): consider charging but not upfront


##  Why this works for you:

- Predictable revenue (100 subscribers = $2k-5k/month)
- Aligned Incentives (Not taking a cut of patient fees)
- Mission-Driven Angles (Foundation can partner with ODHA to subsidize memberships for hygienists serving underserved areas)
- Scales by itself
	- once a hygienist subscribes, each additional patient match costs ~nothing

## Networking:

- Ask Cris
- Can you introduce me to 5-10 hygienists who might pilot-test the app?
- "I need feedback on whether this solves a real problem"
- Write down what the hygienists actually need and what they'd pay for
- (After working MVP) Can she mention it at an ODHA meeting?
- (After Practitioner ~adoption) Can she mention it on her+Steven podcast?
- (Later 2026) Showcase at ODHA big conference event

## But how do we get Clients to use the app?

- ODHA Members
	- You have a built-in distribution channel - ODHA represents 300 of the 400 practitioners in Oregon

## Launch sequence:
- Closed beta with union members (Dec-Jan)
	- Neighbor emails 10-20 hygienists she knows personally: "Testing new tool, free during beta, need your feedback"
	- They try it, you fix the obvious problems, they tell you what's missing
	- These early adopters become your champions when you launch for real
- "Founding member" launch to full union (Feb)
	- Special rate for first 50 signups ($15/month instead of $20, locked in forever)
	- Announced at union meeting + email blast
	- Framing: "Built BY hygienists FOR hygienists" (Cris's credibility matters here)
- Goal: Get to 30-50 paying subscribers before you go public
- Public launch (Mar-Apr-May)
	- Now you have proof: "50 Oregon hygienists already using this"
	- SEO starts working: "EDHS near me" returns your app
	- Word of mouth kicks in
	- Hygienists outside the union hear about it from patients

## Why this works:
- You're not competing with ODHA, you're serving their members (and the 100 non-members can't get this anywhere else)
- The foundation angle makes it a mission, not a cash grab
- Cris presenting at a conference = 300+ potential users see a demo from someone they trust
- The problem is real and urgent - once hygienists see it works, they'll pay to stay visible
- The patient side grows automatically because you're solving the Google problem - you'll be the ONLY result when someone searches EDHS

## Client Discovery

1. Potential clients (patients, care facilities) don't know what this service *is* and that they have the ability to request/ find it directly
2. Patients often avoid the dentist/hygienist or think they can't afford it

Who actually finds these services today?
- Nursing home staff who know EDHS practitioners exist (they call the same 2-3 people repeatedly)
- Adult children googling "mobile dentist for dementia patients" and getting frustrated
- Social workers who have a rolodex of providers
- Someone's friend who says "my hygienist comes to the house!"

Your app needs organic distribution through the people who are ALREADY connecting patients to hygienists:

- Nursing homes/assisted living facilities
	- they're desperate for dental providers willing to come on-site. If 5 hygienists on your app list "nursing home visits" as a service, those facilities will bookmark your app and use it every time they have a new resident who needs care.
- Social workers/case managers
	- they coordinate care for elderly/disabled patients. Get your app into the hands of 10 social workers and they'll use it for years.
- Senior centers/community health clinics
	- print flyers (yes, actually print them) with the URL and "Find dental care that comes to YOU"
- The hygienists themselves
	- give each subscriber a stack of business-card-sized handouts with the app URL: "Find other providers like me at [YourApp].com"

Cris's conference presentation matters MORE for clients than practitioners - if she's presenting to ODHA members, are there also sessions for social workers, aging services coordinators, or community health workers? Those are your patient acquisition channels. Not yet there aren't...


## This Changes MVP
- How do I optimizing the UI for
	- practitioner pitches (this one's covered/obvious)
	- client pitches (patients, patient guardians, care facilities)
	- frictionless app understanding and navigation
	- repeat adoption (for clients)

- Translating unknown/not-fully-groked client need into actual user behavior

- Homepage/About needs to explain WHAT an EDHS is before someone can search? Or have a "Are you a nursing home looking for dental providers?" separate flow?

This is systems thinking about friction points.
Let's map the patient-side acquisition problem:

You have multiple user personas who need DIFFERENT entry points:

**Client 1:** Adult Child Searching for Parent's Care
- Pain point: "Mom's in a nursing home and her teeth are rotting, regular dentists won't come to her"
- Search terms: "mobile dentist nursing home", "dentist for dementia patients", "home dental care elderly"
- What they need to see: Immediate answer that YES, this service exists and is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
- Call-to-action: Search by parent's nursing home zip code

**Client 2:** "Care Facility" Activities Coordinator
- Pain point: I have 80 residents, half need dental care, I call the same hygienist every time and she's booked for months
- Discovery: Probably word-of-mouth from other facilities, or they find you when googling for that one hygienist who's too busy
- What they need: Ability to see ALL providers who service nursing homes in their area, filterable by "accepts Medicaid"
- Call-to-action: Bookmark this, use it weekly
- "care facility" is good because it's general enough to cover nursing homes and prisons and we don't want to write "prisons" on the splash page... how to make it obvious that we mean: Prisons, group homes, psychiatric facilities, rehab centers... all places where EDHS services are desperately needed but you don't lead with that in marketing.

**Client 3:** Low-income Adult Who Can't Afford a Dentist
- Pain point: Tooth pain, no dental insurance, thinks dentist = $500+ bill they can't pay
- Discovery: Honestly? They're probably NOT finding you via Google. They're hearing about it from a community health clinic, food bank, church, or friend
- What they need: Clear messaging that this is AFFORDABLE and covered by Oregon Health Plan
- Call-to-action: Search by their own location (geolocation button)

**Client 4:** The patient who doesn't know they're a patient yet
- Pain point: They've written off dental care entirely, haven't been in years
- Discovery: They're not searching. Someone has to tell them this exists.
- Critical insight: This is Cris's podcast audience. The podcast is actually your long-term patient acquisition engine - if Cris is making oral health education content, every episode should end with "Find a provider at [YourApp].com". That's how you reach Persona 4.


**Client 5:** Dentist Office Searching for Hygienist
- Pain point 1: "My Hygienist is moving to Texas/my practice is growing. How do I find a good one in time to replace her?"
- Pain point 2: "My Hygienist(s) call out sick often enough to affect business and my sanity. How can I get a call chain of other Hygienists willing to travel and fill in on short notice so my patients and my business aren't affected? I'll pay them more for this service."
- Search terms: ???
- What they need to see: ???
- Call-to-action: ???
- "Dental practices: find hygienists available for contract work" + same search is fine for MVP. If dentists start using it heavily, you learn that's a revenue stream (they might pay MORE than $15/month for recruitment tools).


## MVP Homepage

**Design Guide:**
- Show, don't gate
	- Information is immediately available but doesn't overwhelm
	- This is a simple search app - no surprises/ads/asks/tricks
- No medical jargon
- Medicare/Medicaid mentioned early - affordability top of mind
- Educational triage - Explain JUST enough before search, e.g.
- Client Profiles
	- Each client profile gets validation ("this is FOR you") before search
	- Focus on Clients 1, 2? and then 4, 5? for launch?
		- Who is actively searching RIGHT NOW
		- Who has urgency and money/insurance
	- I think we will end up with the client "stories" and client "profiles" not necessarily matching the cards 1:1... how to structure? or we need to rewrite until Nicole is happy with the map between the stories and the entity.cs object... right now it's still messy
- Explainer Accordians and Search Customization
	- Client Profile cards have ***short*** identifiers/explainers
	- Accordion-style expansion on tap/click
	- Add more explantion in the expanded card (don't change original text)
	- Adjust default search mode and filters (highlight box flash?)
	- Example
		- Self-care Seekers (least tech-savvy) <-> Geolocation, 25 mi
		- Facility managers <-> Facility Address, "view all"
		- Dentist Office <-> Facility Address, 25 mi
- Personalization on return
	- log last use case and return to that "personalization"
	- optimizes for "needs context vs already gets it"

**Homepage:**
- Top section (immediate, no clicks):
	- Headline: "Find dental care that comes to you" (simple, clear promise)
	- Headline: "Find licensed dental hygienists in Oregon"
	- Subhead: "Connect with licensed dental hygienists who provide care in dentist offices, nursing homes, assisted living, and your home" (explains the service without jargon)
	- Three entry paths (cards or buttons):
		- Card 1: "I need care for [myself or] a family member"
			- Icon: family/person
			- One-line explainer on click/tap, expand to explain more: "Find hygienists who visit nursing homes, assisted living, and private homes"
			- Click → Quick explainer page: "Expanded Practice Dental Hygienists (EDHS) can provide dental cleanings, screenings, and preventive care without a dentist present. Many accept Medicare and Medicaid." + [Search by location] button. Alt text: "EDHS practitioners can provide care in nursing homes without a dentist present, often covered by Medicare"
		- Card 2: "I manage a care facility"
		- Icon: building
		- One-liner: "Find providers who service nursing homes, group homes, and care facilities"
		- Click → Brief pitch: "Keep your residents healthy with regular dental visits. EDHS practitioners come to your facility." + [Search by facility address] + option to "View all providers" (no distance filter)
		- Card 3: "I need dental care for myself" - I think combine with Card1 so we can get the dentist office in
			- Icon: person with tooth/smile
			- One-liner: "Affordable dental care, often covered by Oregon Health Plan"
			- Click → "If you can't afford traditional dental care or have trouble getting to appointments, EDHS practitioners may be able to help. Many accept Medicaid." + [Find care near me] button (geolocation)
			- how to hint at/combine this/ I have no contacts with those kinds of centers right now... I'd have to see how the hygientists would even want to do it... skip? can we get it combined with Card 1 or no because tots different client?
		- Card 4: Dentist Offices... I really want ot have this one on there, I watched my dentist go through this and I think it's a paying customer who would use a website, unlike card3 who might not use the internet and might need fliers etc from trusted outreach persons (e.g. social worker, community center, library, etc)
	- Hamburger Menu:
		- About / FAQ Page
		- Practitioner signup
			- "Are you a dental hygienist?"
			- (probably not active in MVP but I could put it there to show off possibilites to potential practitioner users)
		- Cris's podcast on oral health (when it launches)
		- Foundation for OR/Hillsboro Oral Health (when it launches)
		- Contact
		- Privacy




Subhead: "Dental care in nursing homes, assisted living, your home, or your office. Often covered by Medicare and Medicaid."
Search Div: vertical
	- "Use my location"
	- "Use zip" 
	- "Use address"
	- [Search] button
	- UserMaxSearchMiles dropdown filter (updates according to selected client profile)

About Page:
At top, simple text, scannable, no cards/boxes:

"Dental hygienists listed here can provide cleanings, screenings, and preventive care without requiring a dentist appointment." - we are changing to more than just the EDHS people, so this needs a rewrite

"Looking for a hygienist for your dental practice? [Search by location]" (loads to this persona selected on search page)

"Managing a care facility? Search by your facility's address to find providers in your area. [Search by address]." Same, returns all practitioners.

Below the use cases paragraphs: 
FAQ (accordions):
 - "What is an EDHS?"
 - "Does Medicare cover this?"
 - "How do I know they're licensed?"

Mobile-first approach:
- First visit (detected by cookie/session):
	- Headline: "Find licensed dental hygienists in Oregon"
	- One-sentence explainer: "Dental care in nursing homes, assisted living, or your home"
	- Search box (zip/address)
	- Small "Use my location" link
	- Below search: Expandable accordion or "Learn more ▼" that reveals the context (Medicare/Medicaid, what EDHS means, dentist offices, facility managers)
	- This keeps the screen clean but information is ONE tap away, not gated behind declaring yourself
- Return visit:
	- Just headline + search box
	- "Learn more" still there but collapsed by default
	- They've already decided you're legit, get out of their way

**Cookies:**
- Store in localStorage (persists across sessions, doesn't require server): last search location, last distance filter, maybe last "customer type" if you end up with those toggles
- On return visit: pre-fill the search box, auto-select their last distance radius
- Small "Clear" or "Search somewhere else" if they want to reset

**Portfolio talking point**:
- I think about humans, not just features: "Implemented contextual UX that adapts to user familiarity, reducing friction for repeat users while maintaining accessibility for first-time visitors."
