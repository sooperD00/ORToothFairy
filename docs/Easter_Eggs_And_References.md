## 🗺️ Oregon Connection

While our pioneers practiced on the East Coast, Oregon has been a leader in expanding dental hygiene scope of practice:

- **1995:** Oregon passes legislation allowing independent practice for dental hygienists (one of the first states)
- **EDHS License:** Expanded Practice Dental Hygienist credential allows practice without dentist supervision
- **400+ EDHS practitioners** in Oregon today (compared to ~50 in most states)

**EDHS Finder continues the legacy** of making preventive dental care accessible, independent, and patient-centered.

- Use birth/founding years in phone numbers or IDs (1906, 1913, 1959)
- Use period-appropriate terminology in services ("Oral Prophylaxis" for Newman, "Evidence-Based Practice" for Wilkins)
- Keep it respectful—these are real people who shaped the profession

**When explaining to non-technical users:**
- "We named our test data after the pioneers of your profession"
- "It's our way of honoring the history while building the future"
